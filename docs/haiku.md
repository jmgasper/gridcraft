# GridCraft on air/OS (and Haiku)

Status: first working build, 2026-10-17. GridCraft runs as a native air/OS application: the
whole interface (ribbon, Backstage, dialogs, the grid, charts) and everything below it are the
same code as on the other desktops; only the host around the interface is new. The host is the
one WordCraft's air/OS port uses (`storytold/wordcraft`'s fork, `apps/wordcraft-haiku`), adapted
to GridCraft's `SheetApp`.

## How it fits together

| Desktop app (`apps/gridcraft`) | air/OS app (`apps/gridcraft-haiku`) |
| --- | --- |
| eframe + winit window | `BApplication` + `BWindow` + `BView` (`native/host.cpp`) |
| wgpu renders egui's meshes | software rasteriser draws them into a `BBitmap` (`src/raster.rs`) |
| rfd file dialogs | `BFilePanel` Open and Save panels |
| arboard clipboard | `BClipboard` (`text/plain` and `text/html`) |
| winit cursors | `BCursor` system cursors |
| xdg-open for links | `BUrl::OpenWithPreferredApplication` (http, https and mailto only, as on the desktop) |
| OS locale | `BLocaleRoster` (preferred languages, formatting conventions) |
| Finder / Explorer open | `B_REFS_RECEIVED` (Tracker double-click, Open With, drops) |

eframe, winit and wgpu don't run on Haiku, so `SheetApp` (the interface, `crates/ui-egui`) is
driven directly: the host turns Be API messages into egui input, runs `SheetApp::logic` and
`SheetApp::ui` as eframe does, and turns egui's output back into window, cursor, clipboard and
URL calls. The control server and the log file are the desktop app's own modules
(`apps/gridcraft/src/control_server.rs`, `logging.rs`). Nothing below the interface knows it is
on Haiku apart from the font folders (`/boot/system/data/fonts`, Noto Sans for the interface and
cells, Noto Sans CJK, Thai and Symbols as fallbacks).

Threads: `be_app` runs on the main thread, the window on its looper thread, and the interface
on a thread of its own, which waits on the host's event queue between frames. GridCraft's file
pickers return a path (`Services::pick_open`), so while a file panel is open the interface
thread waits for its answer and keeps the window's other events for afterwards. Only
`src/host.rs` contains `unsafe` code (the FFI calls); the crate denies it everywhere else.

Settings and logs live in `~/config/settings/GridCraft` (`ui.json`, `prefs.json`, `logs/`).
Files GridCraft saves get their MIME type (`update_mime_info`), so Tracker opens them with it;
at start GridCraft becomes the preferred application of the spreadsheet types that have none,
and the package's post-install script does the same before it has ever run.

### Drawing

egui's meshes are premultiplied sRGB triangles. `raster.rs` draws them on the processor:
axis-aligned rectangles (cells, panels, glyphs, pictures) and flat triangles take fast paths;
the frame is split into bands of 32 rows drawn in parallel (rayon), and a band whose shapes,
clips and textures are unchanged since the last frame is skipped, so a blinking caret or a
keystroke redraws a few bands, not the window. Only the rectangle that changed is copied into
the `BBitmap` and redrawn.

On an air/OS desktop drawn at a higher density (175 % on the Framework laptop, 200 % on 4K
monitors), the frame is rendered in device pixels and drawn with `DrawBitmap(bitmap, device
rect, logical rect)`, so app_server copies it one to one and text stays sharp. The density comes
from air/OS's display layout (`BPrivate::get_display_layout`, looked up at run time, so plain
Haiku gets 1); the interface scale follows the system font size (12 pt = 100 %) on top of
GridCraft's own interface size setting. `GRIDCRAFT_DEVICE_SCALE` overrides the density.

### Keys

Haiku's Command key (left Alt by default) and Control both act as Excel's Ctrl, so Command+B,
Command+S, Command+C/V work as Haiku users expect and Ctrl+B as Excel users expect. Option (the
Windows key) is Excel's Alt (key tips). `BWindow`'s own Command+X/C/V/A/W shortcuts are removed
so the interface gets them. Letters are identified by the keymap (`raw_char`), so shortcuts
follow the user's layout.

## Building

The Rust code is cross-compiled on Linux with current stable Rust, building `std` for the
tier-3 target `x86_64-unknown-haiku` from `rust-src`:

```sh
# once: rustup with rust-src, and a sysroot of an air/OS machine's development files
export RUSTUP_HOME=/mnt/HaikuWork/toolchains/rust/rustup CARGO_HOME=/mnt/HaikuWork/toolchains/rust/cargo
curl -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y --no-modify-path --profile minimal -c rust-src
# sysroot: /boot/system/develop/{lib,headers} copied (dereferenced) into
# $HAIKU_SYSROOT/boot/system/develop, plus libstdc++/libgcc_s from gcc_syslibs

bash tools/haiku/build.sh          # target/x86_64-unknown-haiku/release/GridCraft
bash tools/haiku/package.sh        # artifacts/haiku/gridcraft-<version>-x86_64.hpkg
```

`tools/haiku/env.sh` sets the toolchain up (the Haiku cross gcc for linking and for
`native/host.cpp`, `RUSTC_BOOTSTRAP=1` for `-Zbuild-std`). The package step needs a Haiku
machine for `rc`, `xres`, `mimeset` and `package`: the test VM, or the workstation with
`GC_PKG_HOST=ws`. `tools/haiku/make-icon.py` generates the original native vector icon
(`GridCraft.hvif`) and a matching SVG preview; see the icon section below.

The platform-neutral parts (the rasteriser, the key tables) are tested anywhere:
`cargo test -p gridcraft-haiku`. Elsewhere the binary only says it needs Haiku.

## Testing

- `tools/haiku/vm/run-vm.sh` boots a throwaway Haiku VM (VNC 127.0.0.1:5910, SSH 2230) as an
  overlay on another project's disk; `tools/haiku/vm/haiku.sh` runs commands in it,
  `tools/haiku/vm/vm.py` takes screenshots and sends clicks, keys and wheel turns, and
  `tools/haiku/vm/ctl.sh` talks to the control channel of a copy started with `--control 7979`
  (e.g. `ui.screenshot`).
- `RUST_LOG=GridCraft*=debug` logs keys, clipboard output and each frame's timings (interface,
  tessellation, rasteriser, present) to `~/config/settings/GridCraft/logs/`.

## Known gaps

- No printing yet (Haiku's print kit is not wired up); export to PDF works.
- No input methods (`B_INPUT_METHOD_EVENT`) yet, so CJK input methods don't reach the grid.
- The window's size and position aren't remembered between runs, and fullscreen and the
  maximized state aren't reported (Haiku has zoom, not maximize).
- No GPU path: very large windows at 200 % cost more processor time per full redraw.

## Native application icon (2026-10-26)

The air/OS icon is an original green spreadsheet ledger, selected cell and chart, licensed under
MIT OR Apache-2.0. Its 64-unit vector drawing follows the
[Haiku icon guidelines](https://www.haiku-os.org/development/icon-guidelines):
vertical edges stay upright in perspective, the main light comes from the top
left, the right faces are darker, a floor shadow extends to the right, and the
silhouette has a two-unit black outline (one pixel at 32px). Broad details are
intended to remain legible at 16px and 32px. No fonts or third-party artwork are used.

Rebuild both the native HVIF and its SVG preview from this checkout:

```sh
python3 tools/haiku/make-icon.py
```

`apps/gridcraft-haiku/resources/GridCraft.hvif` is the packaged icon;
`apps/gridcraft-haiku/resources/GridCraft.svg` exports the same geometry for inspection.
The existing `.rdef` imports the HVIF, and `tools/haiku/package.sh` embeds it in
the executable's resources. Tracker and Deskbar therefore use the vector icon.
The upstream icons for other platforms remain separate. Native previews can be
rendered on Haiku with `BIconUtils::GetVectorIcon`; review at 16, 32, 64 and 128px
on light and dark backgrounds before changing the drawing.

Package version `0.7.0~airos1-4` includes this icon update.
